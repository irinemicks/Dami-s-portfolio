Analytics Portfolio
This portfolio contains some sample analytics projects I worked on: 
1.  A condensed dynamic perfomance report that uses switch measures and conditional formatting.
2.  Mysellar Global Sales Report 2021

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and analytical insights derived from Mysellar's global sales data for the year 2021. It highlights revenue trends, profit distribution, regional performance, category breakdowns, and shipping efficiency across various markets.

*This report is a fictional dataset visualization created for portfolio or demonstration purposes.

3.  A GDP report
    This dashboard presents a snapshot of Nigeria's real GDP performance in Q1 2024, visualized using key economic indicators, comparative quarterly data, and growth trends. It is a practical example of how I 
   translate macroeconomic data into digestible visual insights using Power BI.
